0,High court voids notorious religious leader Siddhababa’s rape charge acquittal,Onlinekhabar,"Biratnagar, May 18

The Biratnagar High Court has voided the Sunsari District Court’s decision to acquit controversial religious leader Krishna Giri aka Siddhababa of a rape charge.

In December 2020, the Sunsari District Court acquitted him of the rape charge. However, expressing dissatisfaction with the verdict, the government attorneys have filed an appeal for the review.

In response to the appeal, a division bench of officiating chief justice Satya Mohan Joshi Tharu and Kiran Kumari Gupta decided the acquittal order would not be implemented.

The high court has ordered the district court to conduct a trial for the rape charge again.

The full text of the acquittal verdict made public in February 2021 had revealed that the district judge acquitted the ‘ascetic’ Siddhababa citing the alleged victim ‘surrendered’ her body to him, and it was widely criticised.

Following that, the government attorneys had decided to appeal to a higher court for the review.",0
1,"Govt hikes public bus fares again, 2nd in 2 months",Onlinekhabar,"Kathmandu, May 18

The government on Tuesday hiked inter-province public bus fares owing to a recent increase in the prices of petroleum products.

This is the second public bus fare hike in the past two months as the government had made a similar decision in April also. In the April decision, the government had also said it would adjust the transport fares every time the fuel price changes by more than 5 per cent from now onwards. 

Accordingly, the Department of Transport Management under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport of the federal government made the announcement on Tuesday.

The decision comes into effect on Wednesday. You can find the details of the hike here.

The department says the fare of passenger vehicles has increased by 3.5 per cent whereas that of load-carrying vehicles has gone up by 4.6 per cent and 5.1 per cent respectively in hilly and plain regions.",0
2,Understanding Balen Shah’s likely victory as Kathmandu mayor in 5 points,"Nishant PokharelMay 19, 2022","The recent local elections were full of surprises, especially the waves of individual independent candidates leading the polls in various municipalities. Among many, the major hotspot of this movement lies with Balen Shah (also referred to as Balendra Shah or Balen only), a notable singer of a particular music genre called rap.

Balen Shah is also a structural engineer and prides himself on his background. Initially, his candidacy for the Kathmandu mayorship was marked as something of a “joke,” and people have called his winning lead “a fluke.” However, while many have opted for a polarised view on the topic, Kathmandu voters have turned fanatic; the Nepali highbrows do not know what to make of it.

Is this an individual triumph, or is this a political trend? Various questions arise: Is this an attack on the system or the political direction? Is this a shift in the voting pattern? Has ethnic bloc voting and chain voting been a thing of the past? And, what does this result reveal about the future?

Let’s discuss everything in turn.",0
3,"Nepal football controversy: ANFA panel submits report, but no one knows what’s in it",Onlinekhabar,"Kathmandu, May 18

A panel formed to look into the recent controversy in Nepal football has submitted its report to the national football governing body, the All Nepal Football Association.

Although the committee led by former Nepal international Victor Pradhan submitted the report to ANFA General Secretary Indra Man Tuladhar on Wednesday, it has not been made public.

Tuladhar says the report will be made public within a week.

“We will make a decision about it as soon as possible,” he says.

On April 27, 10 players of the national team had left the camp after arguments with their coach Abdullah Al Mutairi. The coach has already called in new players to replace them.

The players since then had been meeting high-ranking officials of Nepali sports pleading their case and asking for action against Al Mutairi, who later wrote to ANFA stating he had forgiven the players who left but was not going to take them to the Asian Cup Qualifiers 2023.",0
4,Cheap version of Merck COVID pill to be made for poorer nations,By Reuters,"BRUSSELS, Jan 20A U.N.-backed agency has struck a deal for nearly 30 generic drugmakers to make low-cost versions of Merck & Co's COVID-19 pill molnupiravir for poorer nations, widening access to a drug seen as a weapon in fighting the pandemic.The antiviral drug, which in December received emergency approval in the United States, reduces hospitalizations and deaths of high-risk patients by around 30%, according to clinical trial results. The agreement, negotiated by the U.N.-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) with Merck, allows 27 generic drugmakers from India, China and other countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East to produce ingredients and the finished drug.The MPP said on Thursday the deal stipulated the pill would be distributed to 105 less-developed nations.The developers of molnupiravir, which alongside Merck are U.S. firm Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and Emory University, will not receive royalties for the sale of the low-cost versions produced by generic drugmakers while COVID-19 remains classified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO).""This is a critical step towards ensuring global access to an urgently needed COVID-19 treatment and we are confident that, as manufacturers are working closely with regulatory authorities, the anticipated treatments will be rapidly available,"" said MPP Executive Director Charles Gore.Bangladesh's Beximco Pharmaceuticals, India's Natco Pharma, South Africa's Aspen Pharmacare Holdings and China's Fosun Pharma are among generics firms that will produce the finished product.",0

8,Ram Kumari Jhakri’s claim that Oli didn’t bring any Covid-19 vaccine was false,Injina Panthi,"Ram Kumari Jhakri, a politician associated with the proposed Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Socialist, a breakaway faction of the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist, speaking on the Yoho Bahas programme aired on August 18 on Yoho TV falsely claimed that Nepal could not import Covid-19 vaccine during the tenure of the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli. 

During the interview, she said Prime Minister Oli issued a ‘pointy map’ of Nepal and hastily inaugurated the Dharahara in an attempt to project himself as a nationalist and development-oriented leader. She also claimed that there was no development project that was started and completed during his tenure.

She said in the interview, “Show me just one development project that was started and completed during his tenure. Not even the vaccine came. Not even the vaccine, you know….His advisors were tweeting that the 7 million vaccine doses donated by the US to Asia were for Nepal. He would mislead people with such claims and is still trying to do so.”

The claim by Jhakri, who is also a lawmaker in the House of Representatives, that no vaccine came during Oli’s tenure is false.",1
9,"Some Nepali social media users shared 5G increases Covid-19 cases. But, it’s baseless",Deepak Adhikari,"A false claim about 5G, which is the fifth generation of wireless telephony, is circulating among social media users in Nepal. The claim along with photos of anti-5G protests says Nepal has fewer Covid-19 cases because it has not rolled out the 5G technology; the pandemic is surging in India due to the 5G radiation and the death rates are high in the Indian states where the technology has been launched.

A Pokhara-based photographer and disk jockey, Ohm Lama, shared the post and photos on Facebook on May 9. His post has been shared by more than 4,500 people.

The post reads as follows:

“Since Nepal has not yet launched 5G, Covid cases are fewer here. And, even the existing Covid cases here were caused by the radiation from 5G in India. In India, wherever 5G services have started, the death rates have been rising. For example, 5G testing is currently underway in Bombay, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Karnataka. And, in their surrounding areas, people have shown various symptoms such as burning sensation and redness in eyes, dry throat, excessive thirst, breathing difficulties, etc.”

The same content has been shared on Facebook here, here and here. The claim includes photographs of the anti-5G protests in London of the UK and in Amsterdam of the Netherlands.

Last year, similar claims had gone viral in various European countries including the United Kingdom. India’s Alt News and Factly have also fact-checked such claims.

Now, South Asia Check has investigated the false claim, which is currently circulating among Nepalis.",1
