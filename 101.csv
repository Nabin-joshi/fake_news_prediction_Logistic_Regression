","Offering some respite to the general public grappling with the spike in fuel prices, Nepal Oil Corporation has decided to reduce the prices of petrol, diesel and kerosene despite facing huge losses after the government announced it would lift taxes levied on fuel.A meeting of the ruling coalition held earlier today had decided to adjust the price of petroleum products in an attempt to reduce the problems suffered by the general public due to skyrocketing fuel prices. Following the Cabinet's decision, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies Dilendra Prasad Badu stated that the prices of petroleum products have been reduced by removing taxes.Thus, the price of petrol has been slashed by Rs 20 per litre to Rs 179 a litre.

6,"In Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, the pace and authenticity of post-2015 heritage restoration has been different",Ashish Dhakal,"Restoration of monuments damaged in the 2015 earthquake have been carried out differently in Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, and this has depended a lot on the political will and community involvement to adhere to traditional building methods and materials.The cohesiveness of the community living in the historic core of the three cities has also determined the pace and accuracy of reconstruction after the 2015 earthquake.Since Bhaktapur and Lalitpur have retained much of the historic sense of community and have elected more accountable mayors, restoration there has gone much better than in Kathmandu.
The Trailokya-Mohan Narayan temple in Kathmandu was originally built in the late 17th century by Parthivendra Malla, Pratap Malla’s son – which makes the white walls uncharacteristic. Photo: ASHISH DHAKAL.
For example, restoration work on the Trailokya-Mohan Narayan temple in Kathmandu is now complete. The plastered walls, wooden colonnade, cornices and tile roofs of the three-storey shrine on a five-stage brick plinth at Hanuman Dhoka have returned to their pre-2015 state.However, for specialists like German architect Wolfgang Korn, the restoration is not quite what it should be. He was surprised to see that the temple had been rebuilt with unpainted plaster that is Rana-style, and not Malla-era as it should be.“The struts in Malla-era temples are always carved, with the red dachi appa used as veneer bricks,” says historian Dinesh Raj Panta, according to whom the temple was originally built in the late 17th century by Parthivendra Malla, Pratap Malla’s son. This makes the white walls uncharacteristic.
Restoration of the nearby Maju Dega is not yet complete, and scaffolds and green net cover the construction. Korn, who made detailed measurements of the temple in the 1970s (see accompanying piece, below) fears that Maju Dega will also repeat the mistakes on the Trailokya-Mohan Narayan.“The Department of Archaeology requires only traditional materials and methods be used in rebuilding these sites,” says Korn. “So, I ask myself why this Rana-style on a Malla-era temple? Where are the carved struts?”",1
7,KP Sharma Oli wrongly refers to little people of Africa as ‘Lilliput’,Sanjog Shiwakoti,"CPN-UML chairman and former Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, speaking at a function organised by the party’s youth wing National Youth Federation in the capital on September 6, criticised his former party colleagues and the current government. In his almost hour-long speech, Oli attacked the parties in the ruling alliance, particularly the Madhav Kumar Nepal-led splinter group and the Maoists.
Oli said, “There’s a tribe in Africa called Lilliput. They are small people. They begin reproduction when they are seven or eight years old. By the age of 15, they become old and stop reproduction.  Most die at the age of 20, and if someone reaches 25, they would be happy just like when we turn 100 years old. [In Africa], there’s a small tribe, which is unique and is called Lilliput.”
South Asia Check examined the claim.Oli claimed that there are little people called Lilliput in Africa. But, there is no such tribe called Lilliput.Lilliput in fact is the fictional island nation in Jonathan Swift’s famous novel Gulliver’s Travels, published in 1726. In the novel, Lilliput is home to tiny people called Lilliputians, who are just six inches tall. In Lilliput, it is not only people who are short but the whole environment and infrastructures are tiny, too. In the novel, which the British newspaper The Guardian ranked one of 100 best novels in 2013, Swift, an Irish satirist, chronicles the journey of Lemuel Gulliver, the book’s protagonist. The book does not mention the Lilliputians’ biological characteristics but describes them as smart, selfish and violent people. The novel also features Blefuscudians, inhabitants of another tiny island called Blefuscu. Blefuscudians are the enemies of Lilliputians.Our research found that Oli’s description of the people somewhat matched the Pygmy tribes who live in Africa and Asia. Pygmies are hunter-gatherers and are around five feet tall. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the most known pygmies live in tropical Africa. They live in the jungles of central and west Africa in countries such as Cameroon, Rwanda, Burundi and Congo. Their population is estimated at 120,000.",1
8,Nepal struggles with high adolescent fertility rate,"Rastriya Samachar Samiti
","Fertility rate among adolescents is found to be high in Nepal.According to the Child Welfare Division, fertility rate among adolescents (15-19 age group) is 63 per cent. At an interaction on 'Family planning and reproductive health' organised by the Division here today, Division senior community nursing administration Kabita Aryal said, ""Nepal needs to reduce the fertility rate to 30 per cent by 2030 as per the Sustainable Development Goals. In Nepal, adolescent fertility rate is high and the province wise data shows that Madhesh and Karnali provinces are ahead in this.""It is 61 per cent in Province 1 while 96 per cent in Madhesh, 40 per cent in Bagmati, 58 per cent in Gandaki, 57 per cent in Lumbini, 81 per cent in Karnali and 60 per cent in Sudurpaschim.Teenage pregnancy poses high risk of unnecessary health complications among expectant mothers and increases the risk of maternal mortality rate. The chance of dying in adolescent pregnancy is twice high than in 20-24 years of age, according to Aryal.The existing total fertility rate in Nepal is 2.3 and it was 6.3 in 1976. Increase in marriageable age, use of contraceptive methods, legalisation of abortion and the spousal separation are among the factors for reduced fertility rate in the country.She said the unwanted pregnancies will increase with the decline in the access to and use of contraceptives and this will result in an increase in the number of those undergoing unsafe abortion, thereby increasing the risk on women's health.Teenage pregnancy poses high risk of health complicationsAccording to her, it is also necessary to increase the rate of use of modern contraceptive devices.Forty-three per cent of the total population uses contraceptives in Nepal at present. The government target is to upscale it to 60 per cent until 2030.Similarly, it is stated that the offspring and mother will have better health if children are produced in a gap of three years.Senior Nursing Administrator Aryal said the maternal death rate will be reduced by 30 per cent and the infant mortality rate by 10 per cent while giving birth to children in a gap of three years.The number of persons undergoing permanent family planning is decreasing in the country.The percentage of people undergoing permanent family planning measures has decreased, while the number of people using temporary family planning measures has increased in the last one decade.The percentage of males undergoing vasectomy operation in 2006 was 6.4 and it dropped to 5.5 in 2016.Likewise, the percentage of women undergoing laparoscopy operation for permanent birth control in 2006 was 18 and this decreased to 14.7 in 2016.",0
9,Ram Kumari Jhakri’s claim that Oli didn’t bring any Covid-19 vaccine ,Injina Panthi,"Ram Kumari Jhakri, a politician associated with the proposed Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Socialist, a breakaway faction of the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist, speaking on the Yoho Bahas programme aired on August 18 on Yoho TV falsely claimed that Nepal could not import Covid-19 vaccine during the tenure of the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli. 
During the interview, she said Prime Minister Oli issued a ‘pointy map’ of Nepal and hastily inaugurated the Dharahara in an attempt to project himself as a nationalist and development-oriented leader. She also claimed that there was no development project that was started and completed during his tenure.
She said in the interview, “Show me just one development project that was started and completed during his tenure. Not even the vaccine came. Not even the vaccine, you know….His advisors were tweeting that the 7 million vaccine doses donated by the US to Asia were for Nepal. He would mislead people with such claims and is still trying to do so.”
The claim by Jhakri, who is also a lawmaker in the House of Representatives, that no vaccine came during Oli’s tenure is false.",1
10,Commentator Saurabh  claims a 1958 postage stamp had a ‘pointy map’ of Nepal,South Asia Check,"Writer and political commentator Saurabh speaking on the Tamasoma Jyotirgamaya programme aired on AP1 television on July 19 claimed that a postage stamp issued by the Nepal government in 1958 features a Nepal map with a pointed spur on the northwestern corner.
He made the claim in the context of the immediate past government issuing a new map of Nepal last year by including Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura areas within the Nepali territory. The inclusion of these areas, which are also claimed by India, has added a pointed spur on the northwestern corner of the Nepal map. Nepal adopted the map in June 2020 with the passage of a related bill by parliament.
“As far as I remember, the postage stamp issued in 2015 BS [1958-59 AD] had a pointy map [of Nepal]. But, the Nepal map published in the postage stamp issued after 2017 BS [1960] doesn’t have that pointy part. He [Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli] brought that pointy part back.”
Saurabh, whose real name is Dinesh Satyal, made the claim while reviewing the three and a half years’ term of the immediate past government led by KP Sharma Oli.",1
11,Some Nepali social media users shared 5G increases Covid-19 cases,Deepak Adhikari,"A claim about 5G, which is the fifth generation of wireless telephony, is circulating among social media users in Nepal. The claim along with photos of anti-5G protests says Nepal has fewer Covid-19 cases because it has not rolled out the 5G technology; the pandemic is surging in India due to the 5G radiation and the death rates are high in the Indian states where the technology has been launched.
A Pokhara-based photographer and disk jockey, Ohm Lama, shared the post and photos on Facebook on May 9. His post has been shared by more than 4,500 people.
The post reads as follows:
“Since Nepal has not yet launched 5G, Covid cases are fewer here. And, even the existing Covid cases here were caused by the radiation from 5G in India. In India, wherever 5G services have started, the death rates have been rising. For example, 5G testing is currently underway in Bombay, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Karnataka. And, in their surrounding areas, people have shown various symptoms such as burning sensation and redness in eyes, dry throat, excessive thirst, breathing difficulties, etc.”
The same content has been shared on Facebook here, here and here. The claim includes photographs of the anti-5G protests in London of the UK and in Amsterdam of the Netherlands.
Last year, similar claims had gone viral in various European countries including the United Kingdom. India’s Alt News and Factly have also fact-checked such claims.",1
12,Corruption case against three in Bara's Jitpursimara,Himalayan News Service,"The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority has filed a corruption case against three persons, including a former chief administrative officer of Jitpursimara Sub-metropolitan City, Bara.The case has been filed against former chief administrative officer Shivaraj Sedai of Jitpursimara sub-metropolitan city and contractors Om Sharnkar Prasad and Mira Kumari Shrestha seeking 52.5 million rupees at the Special Court over irregularities in the extraction of river products. The contractors are accused to have committed irregularities during the excavation, collection and distribution of river products from Pasaha and Balgangakhola rivers, according to the charge sheet filed.According to CIAA Spokesperson Shyam Prasad Bhandari, Sedai in capacity of chief administration officer in the fiscal of 2022- 23 had granted licence to excavate river products to Om Shankar's Om Suppliers.But, Om Suppliers is said to have cheated the government by not posting the required revenue in collusion with Sedai.As learnt, the contractor hasn't posted some 10 million rupees government revenue, excluding VAT.

14,No legal clarity on how long the House of Representatives can function after election dates are announced,Binod Ghimire,"The Election Commission said on Friday that it has started preparations to hold the federal and provincial elections by the third week of November.
Speaking at a meeting of the parliamentary committee on Women and Social Affairs, Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Thapaliya said that the elections will be held by November 25.
Meanwhile, Minister for Federal Affairs and General Administration Rajendra Shrestha said the commission has proposed holding the elections in a single phase on November 16, or on November 14 and on November 19 if they are to be held in two phases.
“The government will announce the poll date soon,” he said while addressing the municipal assembly of Kathmandu Metropolitan City on Friday. “The federal and provincial elections will be held in the next four or five months.”
As per the law, the government announces the poll dates in consultation with the commission.
There is, however, one confusion that no one has been able to address. Till when the House of Representatives can function once the election is announced?
Since 1990, after the restoration of democracy, the parliament’s term is fixed for five years. However, Nepal’s democracy has been fragile and constitutions over the years—the country has adopted three charters since 1990—have created quite a confusion.
Gopal Nath Yogi, secretary at the House of Representatives, said there is no legal clarity.
“When a House is prematurely dissolved, poll dates are announced simultaneously. The country then goes to snap polls. However, in case of regular elections, there is no clarity as to how long it can function after election dates are announced,” Yogi told the Post. “It is up to the government when to end the tenure of Parliament.”
As per Article 85, the term of the House of Representatives shall be of five years unless dissolved earlier. It, however, doesn’t say whether or not the House can function after the poll dates are announced.
Usually, dates are announced 120 days prior to the elections, so as to give ample time to the Election Commission for preparations.
A few days ago, the commission made it clear that the current term of the House will be until December 8, clearing the confusion as to when it will complete its five years.
The commission said it has taken December 8, 2017 as the date of commencement of the Parliament tenure as per the House of Representatives and Provincial Assembly Elections Acts. It decided to fix December 8 as the commencement date, saying that on this day the winners of both federal and provincial elections under the first-past-the-post category were announced.",0

16,"Viral on Nepal social media, ‘home remedy’ for boosting blood oxygen levels is founded",Deepak Adhikari,"As the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic rages in Nepal, people have been sharing various kinds of information related to the disease including some supposed home remedies on social media platforms. One such social media post accompanied by a picture suggesting a traditional remedy for low blood oxygen levels has been widely shared on Twitter and Facebook.
The post reads as follows: “Take three-four cubes of camphor, three-four cloves, a teaspoon of carom seeds and two-three drops of eucalyptus oil, wrap up the mixture in a piece of soft cotton cloth and sniff it from time to time. [Every time] after sniffing, put the pouch back into a Ziploc bag. If Eucalyptus oil is not available, you can do without it.”
On April 26, Rama Singh, a former news anchor of the state-run Nepal Television, shared a picture along with the message on her Facebook page. Facebook users have thanked Singh for the information. One user also shared a Hindi-language video clip with instructions for preparing and using the remedy. Singh’s post has received 30 responses and more than 4,000 shares on Facebook. The post along the picture has been shared here and here on Twitter and here and here on Facebook. The post had gone viral in India. In Nepal, it appears that many social media users have shared Singh’s post.
South Asia Check found the supposed remedy is misleading and baseless.According to Prakash Gyawali, a doctor of traditional Ayurveda medicine, although camphor, cloves and carom seeds are natural ingredients used in traditional remedies, the claim that their use boosts blood oxygen levels in humans is unfounded. “The Ayurveda hasn’t described these items as medicines. In order for something to be an Ayurvedic medicine, it has to be mentioned in the related literature,” Gyawali tells South Asia Check.Camphor helps open the nose in case of cold while cloves dry the phlegm, Gyawali says. “Carom seed is also mixed in various medicines. If you have chest problems, it is used because of its expectorant or drying properties,” he says.A mix of eucalyptus oil and herbs can be used to relieve cough symptoms, according to him. “It can be used as a nasal decongestant. It makes it easier to breathe, but there is no evidence that it raises oxygen levels,” he says.Dr Pushpa Mani Kharal, the medical superintendent at Mulpani Municipal Hospital in Kathmandu, says there is no evidence that using the herbs would increase the blood oxygen level. “To increase the oxygen level, your lungs have to be healthy. Or oxygen should be given artificially,” Kharal tells South Asia Check.
“There are other ways such as lying in a prone position (sleeping on your knees and belly), deep breathing, etc. These exercises can make breathing easier,” he says.
Also, we did an extensive search on Google, but could not find any reliable information to support the claim that the aforementioned mixture boosts blood oxygen levels. You can read about the benefits of camphor and clove on WebMD, a US-based publisher of health-related information.
Based on the statements of the two doctors and other references, the widely shared claim that the use of a mix of camphor, clove, carom seeds and eucalyptus oil increases the oxygen level is misleading and baseless.",1
